** Summary

[[http:orgmode.org][Org]] is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists,
and project planning with a fast and effective plain-text
system. This document is intended to teach reader some useful
techniques in org-mode with step-by-step instructions.

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree. 
The headlines in Org start with one or more starts. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
#+END_SRC

* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level


** Lists

*** Unordered lists

- Press 'o' (in vim-mode which create a new line) gives you a new item
- You might also like nested lists
  - like this one (press 'o' to create new item, press 'ESC' return to normal mode, then '>' to indent it)
- You can also reorder list items using M-arrow('j', 'k')
